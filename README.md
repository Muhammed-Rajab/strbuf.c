# strbuf.c
_i don't f--- with null-terminated strings_

### 🚧 Repository under progress 🚧
the code is still being tested *(as of 04/02/26[DD/MM/YY])*. i'm not liable if it breaks your codebase and starts annexing neighbouring countries.

### Why?
for such a great programming language, C is shockingly bad at string handling. i'm currently working on an interpreter in C *(as of 04/02/26[DD/MM/YY])* and i ran head-first into the usual stupidity of managing strings (which is one of the reasons why i stuck with C++ in the past).

well, it is time for me to grow a pair of man and write my own string library like a balls. i'm not aiming for anything super efficient or clean, for that matter. i need something that works that does not rely on prayers, with proper documentation, so i can steal it for my future projects too.

### TODOs
- [x] inplace reversed string
- [x] copy string
- [x] from string literal 
- [x] repeat char n times
- [ ] compare with cstr
